The purpose of this notebook is as follows:

*   Perform an exploratory data analysis on Uber Pickup Data from certain months within the years 2014 & 2015 strictly within New York City to establish key understandings on pickup patterns and user/driver behavior
*   Leverage K-Means algorithm to form clusters within our dataset using pickup location features with the larger intention of defining "hot spots" for pickups throughout New York City
*   Leverage regression analysis for causal inference to estimate the sensitivity of taxi demand to Uber rides supply as well as analyzing market penetration for Uber within NYC
